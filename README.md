# code-gov-stats

A simple app to extract stats about repositories using the Github API and [Cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)

## Dependencies

1. Github: The repo information is completly gathered from Github. There are a number of libraries you can use to accomplish this. We are using [@octokit/rest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/rest).
  - To use the Github API more efficiently you should use a [Personal Github Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). You can then place this token in a `.env` file at the root of the project. For convinience this repo includes a .env-example file that you can rename and use.
2. Cloc: Part of the analysis we are conducting is the cost of software. We are using Cloc to get a project's lines of code. This total is then used with [COCOMO II](http://csse.usc.edu/tools/cocomoii.php) to calculate costs and savings. You can find information for [CLOC here](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).
3. Releases.json: the [Code.gov front-end](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-web) uses a file called [releases.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSA/code-gov-data/master/releases.json?token=AB1ES6AnWo1WleX9jiGx41Kkblnk11pXks5ahbU6wA%3D%3D) where all our code inventory is stored for use. This is going to change in the near future for the use of our API.


## Calculating Cost and Savings

Code.gov estimates the evaluation of the federal open source program by using the Constructive Cost Model II -- CoCoMoII.

- COCOMOII uses a regression formula of historical projects to estimates, size, effort, duration and cost of the software.
- Code.gove uses COCOMOII by counting lines of code in a repository, and assigns an hourly rate of $48 -- the median hourly salary for a software developer and programmer according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.
- Since CoCoMoII calculates based on person-months (19 days), we adjust $48/hr to a monthly cost -- $48(19 days x 8 hours) = $7,296. We keep all factors, such as Risk and Analyst Capability as nominal.
- COCOMOII generates an estimated cost to create the software and the amount of time in person-months to develop the program. 
- The cost becomes our estimated cost to the government to create, or investment. 
- Code.gov multiplies cost by the number of agencies using the program, omitting the creating agency. 
- This becomes our estimated cost-savings, or estimated net profit
- Using investment and net profit we are able to calculate the governmentâ€™s estimated return on investment over the project lifespan and annualized by taking an estimated yearly average.
- To calculate labor hours, we take the person-months and multiply by 152 -- (19 days x 8 hours).
